New features:
- another new song: Sonic the hedgehog CD - Intro (Toot toot sonic warrior!)
- ai balls can now be set to random characters.
- added option for host to force start races
- new texture for Big da Cat
- chat color support! system messages are yellow.
- the game now shows a message when you've been disconnected from a server (or kicked)
Changes:
- lots of small terrain changes at Flame Core - no changes to the route.
- some terrain smoothing on green hill zone for less getting stuck in the ground
- limited characters in username to 32 (no more Wikipedia entries in names)
- limited characters in server names to 64
- also limited chat messages to 128
- "player joined with wrong version" and similar errors are now only visible for the host
- players can now still move after they're done racing (They can't collide with other players)
Bugs fixed:
- Fixed Ame Roes' minimap icon
- Fixed Big da Cat often spawning though the ground on Rainbow Road (and other related spawn-though-ground problems)
- tried to fix the countdown sometimes hanging when all players are ready (this might not work)

Known bugs:
- The game still has a thing where nothing spawns once the stage is loaded. I'll fix this as soon as I trace the problem.
