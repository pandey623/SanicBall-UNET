New content:
- added rainbow road
- new rolling sound. uses same hit detection as jumping - when you hear the sound, you can jump. hit detection is slightly broken though.
- six new songs:
  - Tube and Berger - Straight Ahead (Instrumental)
  - Sonic R - Can you feel the Sunshine?
  - Sonic X theme song (Gotta go fast)
  - Sonic the Hedgehog CD - Sonic Boom
  - Daytona USA - Rolling start
- song playlist now shuffles songs for each race
- added notification at start of game if your resolution is lower than 800x600
- added version checker that tells you if a new version is available - doesn't work for the web player
- new server browser. check the 'show on server browser' checkbox to make your server show up there.
- AI balls now have an auto-respawn timer set to 40 seconds to avoid them getting stuck. This might occasionally have unintended side effects.
Changes:
- tweaks to responsiveness of UI design at low resolutions
- some terrain tweaks on each level - no changes to track layout
- the fancy ball tail's size and length now varies based on your speed
Bugfixes:
- fixed position of big arrows on character selection panel
- fixed AI eggman being a ball ad not an egg
- the minimap now keeps a consistent aspect ratio and no longer cuts off parts of the map on 4:3 resolutions.

Known issues:
- AI balls have really strange hit detection for tire smoke and roll sounds. no idea what causes it.
- Balls get stuck in terrain way too often. I'll get a bandaid fix ready eventually.

also, record times for Flame Core have been reset, as a shortcut has been nerfed.

note about the server browser: you still need to port forward your computer for people outside your local network to join you. If you don't know how to do this, guides are available at portforward.com.
