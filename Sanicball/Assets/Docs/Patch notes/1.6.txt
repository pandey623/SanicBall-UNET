New features:
- Balls now spawn just above the terrain when starting a race. The rows of balls also face the finish line now.
- added Silvur and Chermy as characters; they don't have any unique stats for now, except for Chermy being small.
Changes:
- chat colors are now only shown on names (and not on messages)
- changed the player list to be opened with TAB and contain some more information about each player.
Bugs fixed:
- fixed multiple Big da Cats pushing each other out when spawning
