**You can contrubute by forking the project and submitting a merge request once you feel your changes are done.**

Sanicball has so far been an one man project and it can get pretty exhausting. Therefore any help with development would be very much appreciated.

The Issues page contains most of the project's important short term goals. If I haven't assigned myself to an issue, I haven't started working on it yet, and it is completely open for anyone to start it up.

Small changes can be committed directly to the `dev` branch - but if working on something bigger, please start a new branch, and merge into `dev` once it's stable enough. The `master` branch is reserved for releases.


If you have trouble understanding parts the project structure or code just message me directly (support@sanicball.com).
